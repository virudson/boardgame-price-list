In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock’s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, \u003cem\u003eStockpile\u003c\/em\u003e catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?\u003c\/p\u003e\u003c!--EndFragment--\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",

Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper — but at the risk of ending up with nothing.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll editions of \u003cem\u003eIncan Gold\u003c\/em\u003e and later editions of \u003cem\u003eDiamant\u003c\/em\u003e include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no on can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003c!--EndFragment--\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",

While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players.

The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships.

Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the \"lay\") must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.

The djinn is shuffled into the deck with the other djinns and protects you from the effects of thieves. One thief card is revealed at random at the start of the game, and whenever someone would buy a djinn, they can purchase the thief card for the same price as the djinn. Each thief is associated with one of the tribes, and whenever you take an action with that tribe, you can choose to activate and discard the thief. If you do, everyone else must get rid of something — two resource cards, one tile they control, even a djinn or palace — after which you get to choose to keep something from all the discarded things.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003c!--EndFragment--\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",

Twelve legendary tasks are imposed upon the fearless participants: to erect graceful statues, to raise awe-inspiring sanctuaries, to offer capacious offerings, and to slay the most fearsome monsters.

When the Crimes are known the players place their Suspect cards simultaneously face-down one card per row. Now we're moving to the guessing phase. Each player in her turn gets one guess and says what's the value (from 1 to 5) of chosen opponent's Suspect card. If the guess is right the Suspect is removed and the player who guessed correctly receives a point card. If the guess is wrong the card stays face-up and nothing happens. When each card is turned face-up or removed the Crime phase occurs. The player that placed the highest Suspect card in each row gets the appropriate row of Crime card(s). In case of a tie the tied cards are removed and the next high wins if any.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter several rounds the players score the points for the best three types of Crime cards that they gathered plus the bonuses for right guessing.

Careful use of science can mitigate the harmful effects of industry, and can also help avert global crises.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Energy Empire\" uses worker placement, tableau-building, and resource management mechanics. On each turn, a player can choose to either WORK or GENERATE. On a work turn, a player plays a single worker on the main board, then uses workers and energy to activate cards in their tableau. Players may spend energy to use an occupied space on the main board, so no spaces are ever completely blocked. On a Generate turn, players get to renew their supply of energy by rolling “energy dice” that represent nuclear, coal, oil, solar, and other forms of energy.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStand alone game, part of The Manhattan Project line from Minion Games.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003c!--EndFragment--\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",

These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller. If either no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then he receives no points; if he received some votes but not all of the votes, he scores based on the number of votes received.

During the Witch Hunt, players send residents to jail and provide alibis for their own jailed citizens. At the end of each round all jailed citizens stand trial.

While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect \"epic tales\" cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building\/exploring, and special actions.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCareful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003e \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cem\u003eInis\u003c\/em\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003e \u003c\/span\u003ehas \"dudes\" that are \"on a map\", it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003c!--EndFragment--\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e",

In more detail, the game board shows a map of the United States with certain cities being connect by colored paths. Each player starts with four colored train cards in hand and two tickets; each ticket shows two cities, and you're trying to connect those two cities with a contiguous path of your trains in order to complete the ticket.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn a turn, you either draw two train cards from the deck or discard train cards to claim a route between two cities; for this latter option, you must discard cards matching the color and number of spaces on that route (e.g., two yellow cards for a yellow route that's two spaces long). If you connect the two cities shown on a ticket with a path of your trains, reveal the ticket, place it face up in front of you, then draw a new ticket. (If you can't connect cities on either ticket because the paths are blocked, you can take your entire turn to discard those tickets and draw two new ones.)\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you connect one of the West Coast cities to one of the East Coast cities with a path of your turns, you immediately claim a Coast-to-Coast ticket.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first player to complete six tickets wins!

Each game board shows nine dice, and once arranged the completed grid shows 36 dice, with the dice being numbered 1-6 and showing six colors, with each combination of number and color appearing exactly once. Roll the color die and number die to determine the starting location for the transparent robot, then mark this space with the transparent starting token.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a round, roll the two dice to determine the target space; you can mark this space with a transparent victory token or simply have everyone remember which space they're trying to reach. Everyone simultaneously tries to figure out how to move the robot to the target space, and to move the robot, it must move orthogonally to a space that shares either the color or number of its current location. If the robot starts on \"3-green\", for example, it can move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 3 or is green; if you'd move it to \"5-green\", it can now once again move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 5 or is green; and so on.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs soon as a player has a solution, they yell out the number of moves, then take the robot and demonstrate the solution. If the solution takes exactly the number of moves claimed, the player earns a victory token; if not, the player gives one of their victory tokens (if they have any) to the player with the fewest tokens. In either case, the former target space becomes the new starting space for the next round.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf any player possesses five victory tokens, they win!

Players collect one of these goods when the feature that has it on the tile is scored. Players with the most of each type of good gets bonus points at the end of the game. There is a popular house rule that allows the trading of goods between players in exchange for other goods and the ability to chose where a tile is placed. There are also two new wooden playing pieces in this expansion. The Builder is like a meeple in that it may be placed in a city or road as a kind of supervisor. A subsequent tile extension of the feature the Builder is in allows the player another tile placement. Farmers will also be able to place a new Pig pawn in a field for extra points at the end of the game.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally,\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003e \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTraders \u0026amp; Builders\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003e \u003c\/span\u003ecomes with a large cloth bag.
